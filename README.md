Directory Overview

### `assets/`

Contains all client-side resources used by the web application.

#### `assets/src/`

Houses the application's JavaScript modules:

* **app.js** – Main application entry point responsible for initialising the user interface and coordinating frontend functionality.
* **api.js** – Handles communication between the frontend and backend APIs.
* **cache-buster.js** – Ensures users receive the latest application files by preventing stale cached assets.
* **forecast-chart.js** – Generates interactive demand forecasting visualisations.
* **inventory-dashboard.js** – Displays inventory metrics, KPIs, and stock insights.
* **logout-modal.js** – Controls logout confirmation dialogs and session termination prompts.
* **what-if-panel.js** – Enables scenario planning by allowing users to simulate changes in demand assumptions.
* **data-validator.js** – Validates uploaded datasets and user inputs before processing.
* **pdf-export.js** – Generates downloadable PDF reports and summaries.

Other frontend assets include:

* **index.html** – Main dashboard interface.
* **login.html** – User authentication page.
* **styles.css** – Global styling definitions.
* **manifest.json** – Progressive Web App configuration.
* **service-worker.js** – Enables offline capabilities and caching.
* **favicon.ico**, **favicon/**, and **icons/** – Branding assets and device icons.

---

### `server/`

Contains the application's backend business logic.

* **server.js** – Main Express server configuration and application entry point.
* **forecast-logic.js** – Implements demand forecasting algorithms and prediction workflows.
* **inventory-calculator.js** – Computes inventory recommendations such as reorder points and safety stock.
* **prompt-templates.js** – Stores reusable AI prompts for generating business insights.
* **seasonality-utils.js** – Provides utilities for identifying and applying seasonal patterns.
* **external-factors.js** – Incorporates external variables such as market trends, holidays, or economic influences into forecasting models.

---

### `routes/api/`

Defines RESTful API endpoints exposed by the application.

* **forecast.js** – Forecast generation endpoints.
* **inventory.js** – Inventory optimisation endpoints.
* **products.js** – Product data retrieval and management.
* **scenarios.js** – What-if scenario analysis endpoints.
* **reports.js** – Report generation and export functionality.
